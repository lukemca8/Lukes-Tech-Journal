# Course: Sys-140

This course introduced me to operating system concepts and other forms of systems software. I learned about standard operating systems' functional components such as memory, process/thread, file system, input/output, storage and device management. Additional topics include data representation, imaging, virtualization, and the history/future of systems software. Hands-on experiential learning helped me to reinforce concepts.
