# Assignment 6-1: Initial Research Phase Milestone 1

Securing a LAN is a very important step for setting up a modern network. You can setup a firewall in the router itself preventing harmful and malicious web traffic from coming through into your LAN. WPA2 and WPA3 routers have the ability to have on Wi-Fi network encryption. This encrypts data being sent between the  wireless channel on the router and an end device. Another way is to change the default name and password of your home network.&#x20;

An intrusion detection in a network monitors traffic. The detection evaluates the traffic for any threats, violations of the network policies, and network security breaches or issues. An intrusion detection **system** automates this process with software that is put into the network. If something is in the traffic that causes some suspicion, an alert will go off letting the network admins know.   &#x20;
