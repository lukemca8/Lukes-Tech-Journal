### Notable Policies

#### Participation:

Active participation in this course is particularly important given the multidisciplinary nature of the subject matter and the multidisciplinary makeup of the students in the class. Participation is not solely scored on contribution to class discussions and asking questions class (although that is strongly encouraged). Attentiveness during class discussions, lectures and labs, and fostering an environment conducive to academic inquiry and learning are key.

#### Readings:

In addition, short and simple quizzes on the assigned reading will be conducted at the start of class. These assessments are an additional incentive for students to complete reading prior to the lecture.

#### Cellphones:

Cellphone usage is not permitted during class. If you are expecting an urgent text/call, please inform me in advance.

#### Attendance:

Let Adam Goldstein know in advance if you are going to miss a class.

#### Late Submissions:&#x20;

Unexcused late assignments have a -20% penalty.&#x20;

#### Classroom Culture:&#x20;

Keep up professional and friendly conversation
