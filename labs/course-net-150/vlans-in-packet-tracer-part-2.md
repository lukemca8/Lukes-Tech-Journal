# VLANS in Packet Tracer Part 2

Part 2 of the VLAN lab had me configure inter-VLAN routing on the router. This allows devices from different VLANs to communicate with each other. I set it up in the CLI of the router. All of the sub-interfaces created are within interface fastEthernet0/1. The sub-interfaces act as virtual interfaces that know how to route data.
