# Technical Terms

## Upstream Gateway&#x20;

An upstream gateway is the last network device until the next network segment in the architecture.

## Domain Name System&#x20;

You look up a website in whatever browser you're using. Your OS doesn't know the IP address associated with the website's domain name, so it can't load the page. Luckily, the Domain Name System (DNS) is here to save the day!&#x20;

DNS uses a database hierarchy containing IP addresses and each of their associated domain name.&#x20;

### Records

A resource record (RR) is an entry in a DNS database file. Every RR has specific information on objects (variables, a data structure, a function, or a method). This data contains the following fields; domain name, time to live (TTL), address class, record type, and sometimes other fields are included depending on the RR type.&#x20;

(Explain the data fields)

#### Record types

| Record Type | Use |
| ----------- | --- |
|             |     |
|             |     |
|             |     |
