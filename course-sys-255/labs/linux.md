## Course Progression

#### Lab 01

* Gained familiarity with the course's lab environment.&#x20;
* Configured my own firewall that separates my local area network from the rest of the class (SYS255-WAN).&#x20;
* Configured a Windows 10 machine to communicate with the internet.&#x20;

#### Lab 02&#x20;

* Established my own internal DNS on a Windows Server 2019 in the lab environment&#x20;
* Gained familiarity with Windows Server 2019, and ADDS&#x20;

## Discussion:&#x20;

It is extremely uncommon to come across a business that is entirely Windows, Mac, or Linux. You'll probably encounter a heterogeneous environment where a variety of operating systems are used to carry out the organization's objectives. I will set up the CentOS operating system in this lab. This particular operating system has been pre-built for me and is open source. It will be my responsibility to finish the configuration procedures so that my expanding business can use and manage it. &#x20;

## [Tools](../tools.md)&#x20;

* CentOS Linux&#x20;
* SSH&#x20;
* Bash&#x20;
* OS directory

## [Technical Terms](../technical-terms.md)&#x20;

## Objectives&#x20;

* Gain familiarity with CentOS Linux&#x20;
* Create an A and PTR record in my internal DNS for the new CentOS dhcp01-Luke machine.&#x20;
* Establish an SSH session as Linux user "luke" from wks01 in PowerShell.
* Experiment with the CentOS Linux directory with bash commands on the SSH session.
