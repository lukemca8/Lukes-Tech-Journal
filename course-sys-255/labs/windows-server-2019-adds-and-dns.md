A Domain Name Server (DNS) should be used in a network with many devices so you can automatically associate IP addresses with hostnames. Without a DNS established in the network, you would have to manually associate IP addresses with hostnames. A DNS server and an active directory are paired together on a single platform for ease of use and efficient management.
