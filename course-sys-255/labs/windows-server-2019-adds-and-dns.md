# Windows Server 2019, ADDS, and DNS

## &#x20;(notes while doing the lab)

Configure new workstation:&#x20;

* ip config&#x20;
* cable&#x20;
* rename computer&#x20;
* local admin

## Discussion:&#x20;

A Domain Name Server (DNS) should be used in a network with many devices so you can automatically associate IP addresses with hostnames. Without a DNS established in the network, you would have to manually associate IP addresses with hostnames. A DNS server and an active directory are paired together on a single platform for ease of use and efficient management. This lab uses an active directory and domain service on a Windows Server 2019 VM. &#x20;

### Course Progression:
