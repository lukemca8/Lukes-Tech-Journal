## [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/)

A free commercial-grade network firewall software that was based on FreeBSD OS with a custom kernel. It has a web interface for configuration. No coding knowledge of any kind is needed with configuration, just point and click. It is just the software side of a firewall, so you should purchase or build your own hardware.&#x20;

## [vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html)

A collection of virtualization products, used for creating and operating virtual machine infrastructure. A very cost-effective way to maintain your servers.
