# Lab 10-2

## Objective:&#x20;

1. Step 1: Assigned IP addresses and gateway addresses on Each PC.
2. Step 2: Assign IP Addresses on each Router port
3. Step 3: Configure Static Routes on routers 0, and 1, and RIP Routes to routers 2 and 3. &#x20;
4. Step 4: Create two VLANS on Switch0, name them "Your First Name" and "Your Last Name". Assign port Fa0/1 to "Your First Name" and port Fa1/1 to "Your Last Name"
5. Step 5: At the end "Test Machine" should be able to ping PCs 1, 2 and 3. Screen capture **command line ping** (not PDUs) of "Test Machine" pinging PCs 1, 2, and 3.

## Reflection:

So far I still don't know how to make this network work. I attempted troubleshooting and singling out which router or pc was the culprit, but I never figured out what was wrong with what I built. I configured all of the routers and pcs as asked to the best of my knowledge, but it doesn't ping.
