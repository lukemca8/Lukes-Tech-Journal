# Intro to Packet Tracer and Deploying Pinging Devices

## Summary

In todays lab, I was introduced to Packet Tracer, a simulated network builder. I connected 6 PCs to 2 switches with ethernet cables to create a simple network. I then tested to see if the network was set up properly by pinging one of computer's IP address using the built in command prompt of the simulated computer. 4 replies came back, so it works.
