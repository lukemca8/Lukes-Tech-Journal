# Course: Net-150

In this course I was introduced to networking technology and the integral part it plays in business and society. Organizations expect the communication in information systems will be reliable, effective, and secure. I learned about network protocols, services, and topologies, information security, high-speed LAN/WAN topologies, client-server technology, security vulnerabilities, network troubleshooting. I also gained factual, conceptual, and applied knowledge regarding network communications, security, technology evolution, infrastructure components, management functions, business processes, and design issues.
