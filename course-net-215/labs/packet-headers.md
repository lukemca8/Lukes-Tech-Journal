# Packet Headers

14 bytes are included in the ethernet II header.&#x20;

6 bytes represent the destination MAC and 6 bytes represent the source MAC.

Destination bytes:

`84 17 ef eb d1 bb`&#x20;

Source bytes:&#x20;

```
28 3a 4d 84 e1 7f
```

The Internet Protocol Version 4 header contains 20 bytes.&#x20;

We see the ethernet header as the first bytes in the packet because it is part of the physical layer on the OSI model. The headers seem to go in order on the OSI model.&#x20;
